msmtp (1.8.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Starting from version 1.8.22, msmtp will no longer be SetGID. Hence the
    creation of the system-wide configuration (/etc/msmtprc) using debconf is
    removed.

    From one side, using the system-wide configuration implied msmtp to be SetGID
    but recent security hardening changes in GLib prevent SetGID binaries built
    against libsecret to talk to the D-Bus session, and therefore prevent it from
    being able to retrieve passwords from gnome-keyring or KWallet.

    On another side, it was easy for a local user to obtain the credentials
    stored in /etc/msmtprc even if the file was not readable for this user
    when msmtp was SetGID.

    More information in the following bug reports:
        - https://bugs.debian.org/944188
        - https://bugs.debian.org/995012

    Scripts (msmtpq and msmtpqueue) are now installed in /usr/libexec/msmtp
    instead of /usr/share/doc/msmtp/examples previously.

msmtp (1.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    The system-wide configuration file (/etc/msmtprc) can contain SMTP credentials
    that are best kept secret. To let regular users use msmtp while preventing them
    from reading the file, the permissions can be adjusted that way:

    # chmod 0640 /etc/msmtprc
    # chgrp msmtp /etc/msmtprc

    So that msmtp's binary executing as the "msmtp" group (setgid) can access it.

msmtp (1.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    /usr/bin/msmtp ships with an Apparmor profile restricting what the binary
    can access.
    If you notice Apparmor denial logs in dmesg, please report them as bugs or
    if they are specific to your environment, please add local rules to
    /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.msmtp and reload the main profile with:

    # apparmor_parser -r -T -W /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp

    The usage of secret helpers for the --passwordeval option is limited to
    gpg, gpg2, secret-tool, pass, etc. To use a different helper, edit and
    reload the main profile (/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp). If you'd like
    to disable the Apparmor profile completely:

    # apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp
    # ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
